## Potential Flow over NACA Airfoil

This app uses vortex panel method to compute aerodynamic quantities on NACA airfoils. Detailed information on NACA airfoils could be found on the [Wikipeida article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACA_airfoil). There are different variations of vortex panel method, and the one used here is based on the book *Foundations of Aerodynamics* by Arnold M. Kuethe and Chuen-Yen Chow.
